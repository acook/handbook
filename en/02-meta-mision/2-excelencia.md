##Excelence
We want to stand out in our field by designing, developing and delivering our quality products in a timely manner. This is not just for our clients, but as a guideline to explore our own individual and our team's expertise as well. No matter in which discipline, the constant search for excellency triggers a self-discovery process whose value exceeds that of the actual result. Every attempt at improving your skills and work style will be encouraged, and to that effect, you will get a personal budget to invest in your training from the day you start working at Manas. With that budget you can buy books or materials, attend courses, talks or anything you think will help you grow. You can find out more in the Training section.
