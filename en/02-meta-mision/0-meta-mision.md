##Meta-Mision
>Think only on those things that are in line with your principles and can bear the light of day. The content of your character is your choice. Day by day, what you do is who you become. Your integrity is your destiny.

We at Manas think that heading towards a fixed destination equals missing the chance to discover other places we didn't know about, and that exploring new territory with the right people is a guarantee of results beyond the imaginable. It's because of this that we make decisions and define our path guided by certain principles instead of following a single set-in-stone objective. Our mission is a meta-mission, which is based in finding and improving ways to sustain and represent this principles.
In the following chapters we outline this values, but the real test of how much we work by them is found on a daily basis, and the rest of this manual tries to reflect that.
