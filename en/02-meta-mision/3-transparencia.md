##Transparency
We manage Manas transparently both internal and externally. Transparency builds trust and improves teamwork in pursuit of a common goal. Lack of transparency only adds friction and discomfort, and it gets in the way of productive relationships. There is no top secret files in Manas - income, client fees, expenses and salaries are all freely available internally. We hope that this will enlarge your vision of Manas and will encourage your suggestions or comments if you see anything you find strange or inefficient. Within the [Compensation](../11-compensacion/0-compensacion.md) section you will understand some of the advantages of this model.
